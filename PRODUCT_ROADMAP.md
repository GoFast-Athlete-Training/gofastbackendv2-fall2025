# Product Roadmap

## Premise

This roadmap outlines product features to build over the next 6 months. Simple format: Feature → What it does → APIs needed → Timeline.

**Key Questions:**
1. What feature are we building?
2. What does it do for users?
3. What APIs/backend routes are needed?
4. When will it ship?
