# Working with Adam Cole

## Current Status
- Garmin OAuth user-info endpoint issue identified
- Fixed the endpoint URL to use correct Garmin API
- Added Garmin data to hydrate routes
- Created GarminIntegrationService
- Committed and pushed changes to Render

## What I'm Waiting For
Adam will look up stuff and tell me what to do next.

## What I Should NOT Do
- ❌ Hit backends randomly
- ❌ Make assumptions about the system
- ❌ Go too fast without understanding
- ❌ Try to do everything at once

## What I Should Do
- ✅ Wait for Adam's instructions
- ✅ Follow the repo architecture patterns
- ✅ Use existing systems properly
- ✅ Ask questions when unclear
